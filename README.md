# Ineuron

Assignment 2

# Algorithms

This is a project which I did for our 2nd assignment of Ineuron Full-Stack Java Developer program. In this assignment a seperate program was written to fulfill each requirement:<br/>
<br/>
1. A program to find the duplicates present in an array. <br/>
2. A program to sort an array using Quick Sort Algorithm. <br/>
3. A program to sort an array using Bubble Sort Algorithm. <br/>
4. A program to sort an array using Merge Sort Algorithm. <br/>
5. A program to sort an array using Selection Sort Algorithm. <br/>
6. A program to check whether an array is a subset of another array. <br/>
<br/>
As a bonus I also included a program to find duplicates more than two and a program to remove duplicates and sort array. <br/>
